# MCP Server & Client Demo

This project demonstrates creating an MCP (Message Control Protocol) server and client implementation using two transport systems:
- HTTP
- stdin/stdout

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
2. Add your GROQ API key to the `.env` file:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Getting a GROQ API Key
Sign up for a GROQ account at https://groq.com
Navigate to your account settings
Generate a new API key
Copy the API key and paste it in your .env file
Security Note
Never commit your .env file to version control
Make sure .env is included in your .gitignore file
Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly
Next Steps
After setting up your .env file, you can proceed with running the server and client implementations.
